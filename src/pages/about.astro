                This is a project where I'm just trying to figure out if I should switch to Astro from Next.js 
            </p>
            <p>So far, I see nothing to indicate otherwise, its fast as a rocketship <span class=":uno: i-game-icons-rocket-thruster inline-block" /> because it can ship zero javascript, its easy to work with, and has a beutiful community</p>
            <p>But am I going to switch to it? Currently, probably. Its just so much faster than Next.js, and its just good overall.</p>

            <p>
                I'm just a teenager learning to code, half the time I have know idea what I'm doing half the time, but love doing it! I tend to chase the hype train, and probably use too many tools, but alas, I love doing it.
