    <p>
      <p>
        This is a project where I'm just trying to figure out if I should switch
        to Astro from Next.js
      </p>
      <p>
        So far, I see nothing to indicate otherwise, its fast as a rocketship <span
          class=":uno: i-game-icons-rocket-thruster inline-block"></span> because
        it can ship zero javascript, its easy to work with, and has a beutiful community
      </p>
      <p>
        But am I going to switch to it? Currently, probably. Its just so much
        faster than Next.js, and its just good overall.
      </p>

        I'm just a teenager learning to code, half the time I have know idea
        what I'm doing half the time, but love doing it! I tend to chase the
        hype train, and probably use too many tools, but alas, I love doing it.
