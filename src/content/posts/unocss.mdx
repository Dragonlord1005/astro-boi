UnoCSS was created by Antfu as an [atomic css engine](https://antfu.me/posts/reimagine-atomic-css)

(Note to self, figure out how to change the styling for the link)

## Its greatest features

Why is unocss so good? Well, it generates things dynamically, unlike something like TailwindCSS, where everything is predefined, UnoCSS can just generate it.

```astro
{/* This works in both TailwindCSS and UnoCSS */}
<p class="mt-5">
  {/* This works on UnoCSS but TailwindCSS doesn't know what to do with it. */}
  <p class="mt-15"></p>
</p>
```

It also can use [icons in css](https://antfu.me/posts/icons-in-pure-css), allowing for infinite styling possibilities.

UnoCSS is truly a great css engine, and I hope it gets the attention it deserves.
