UnoCSS was created by Antfu as an [atomic css engine](https://antfu.me/posts/reimagine-atomic-css)

(Note to self, figure out how to change the styling for the link)

## Its greatest features
Why is unocss so good? Well, it generates things dynamically, unlike something like tailwindcss, where everything is predefined, UnoCSS can just generate it.
```astro
{/* This works in both tailwind and unocss */}
<p class="mt-5">

{/* This works on UnoCSS but tailwind doesn't know what to do with it. */}
<p class="mt-15">
```
It also can use [icons in css](https://antfu.me/posts/icons-in-pure-css), allowing for infinite styling possibilities.
